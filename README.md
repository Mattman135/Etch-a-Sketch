# Etch-a-Sketch 
# Live Demo (link should be here when the project is done)

This repo contains the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project (TOP). https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

The project should include
- A 16x16 pixel grid where you can draw
- It should include a "change color" palette
- It should include an eraser button
- It should include a clear button
- It should include a bar where one can change grid size. Minimum 1 and max 100. This range can be changed depending on how the webpage performs

Note
- Use div to create a grid
- Use hover effect and click to change the colors. You need to hover and clicked to change color. Hence hovering over a square isn't enough for it to change color.
- Add a class to the div when changing the color
- Use variables as much as I can to practice. Colors, grid-size.

Extra credit (TOP)
- "Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely"
- "Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions"
